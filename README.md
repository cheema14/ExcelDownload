Welcome everybody! 
This code snippet will help you export CSV in a laravel project without using any package. 
For backend I assume you are using Laravel or any other PHP framework.

For frontend you should have plain Javascript or VueJS or AngularJS. It will work find for any javascript framework.

First of all add an action to your button. 

<button class="btn btn-success" onClick="ExportCSV()">Export</button>

inside your controller you have to put the code which is inside app/http/controllers

Make calculations as per your model and you're done!
